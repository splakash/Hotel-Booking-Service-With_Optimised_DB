🏨 Hotel Booking System Backend
📘 Overview

The Hotel Booking System is a backend service built with Spring Boot that manages hotels (properties), rooms, room types, inventories, and reservations.
It serves as the core backend for a future hotel management or booking platform — handling CRUD operations, relational data, and validations through REST APIs.

This system is designed to simulate a real-world hotel booking service like OYO, Booking.com, or MakeMyTrip but focused on backend design and data relationships.
